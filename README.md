This project is my first React tutorial done through Codecademy.

The project is using the standard React boilerplate.

The files I worked on specifically within this project were:

./src/App.js

./src/components/Business/Business.js

./src/components/BusinessList/BusinessList.js

./src/components/SearchBar/SearchBar.js

./src/util/Yelp.js
